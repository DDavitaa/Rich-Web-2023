# Problem 3 

I changed the theme from cats to metal pipes.
Metal pipes are a meme as they are considered funny for no reason.

## Changelog

These are the changes:

- Changed name of extension in manifest.
- Changed images in array.
- Made sure to run everything after all initial scripts from the webpages have been loaded.
- Changed background to just metal pipes.
- Changed all images to metal pipes.
- Changed what h1 says.
