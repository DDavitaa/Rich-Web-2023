# Problem 3 

I changed the theme from cats to metal pipes.
Metal pipes are a meme as they are considered funny for no reason.

## Changelog

These are the changes:

- Changed name of extension in manifest.
- Changed images in array.
- Made sure to run everything after all initial scripts from the webpages have been loaded.
- Changed background to just metal pipes.
- Changed all images to metal pipes.
- Changed what h1, h2, h3, p, and li says.
- Changed buttons so they lead to www.metalpipe.com
- Changed divs so that they are fully transparent
- Changed spans so that they are red, bold, underlined, and are forced to be uppercase.
- Changed title text.
- Changed favicon so that it shows a random metal pipe icon in the images array.
- Inserted an iframe before h1 that plays a YouTube video of a metal pipe sound.
